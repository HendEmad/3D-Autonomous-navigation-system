    ''' This is done by using sampling. We will extend from the position of the robot a straight line of segment of length equals to the sensor range and along this line
    segment, we will take a number of samples from the environment. If the color of this sample is black, this means an obstacle is reached reached which means we don't 
    need to sample the rest of the line segment. If no obstacles was found, we consider this direction within the sensor range to be obstacle free.
    We repeat this operation while increasing the angle of the line segment until a rotation (360/ ....) is achieved.'''
