# Laser data feature extraction

This is a project based on paper that have a line segment algorithm using laser data based on seeded region growing.

This paper discusses a variation of the famous split and merge algorithm in order to process a 2D lidar data producing a set of line segments that can be used in SLAM applications.

In addition, this paper claims that this algorithm can perform better than the original split and merge algorithm in terms of efficiency, correctness, and precision. Furthermore, the authors provide a clear pesudo code of the algorithm which made the implementation easier.
